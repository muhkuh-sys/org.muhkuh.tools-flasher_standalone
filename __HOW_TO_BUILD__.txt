This is the standalone flasher, a version of the flasher that can be started 
by the netx as a boot image and contains the data to be flashed.

The standalone flasher is just the bare flasher program. In order to use it,
you attach the data to be flashed at the end and adjust the boot header.

How to build
------------

0) Install python 2.7

1) Build the flasher including the library version

  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/muhkuh-sys/org.muhkuh.tools-flasher.git
  cd org.muhkuh.tools-flasher
  python mbs/mbs
  
  This creates the directory 'targets/flasher_lib' containing library versions 
  of the flasher and some includes.

2) Build the standalone flasher 
  
  git clone --recurse-submodules  https://github.com/muhkuh-sys/org.muhkuh.tools-flasher_standalone.git
  
  copy the directory 
  'org.muhkuh.tools-flasher/targets/flasher_lib' to 
  'org.muhkuh.tools-flasher_standalone/flasher_lib'
  
  cd org.muhkuh.tools-flasher_standalone
  python mbs/mbs

3) Build a boot image with data to flashed
  This is done using the python script 'append.py' in the bootimage directory.
  The bootimage directory contains an example that flashes a blinki program.
  
  cd bootimage
  build_bootimages.bat 

  This will create four versions of a boot image for the netX 51/52, running 
  either in internal RAM or SDRAM, and a version of each with additional output.

Booting a netX via Ethernet
---------------------------

The netX 51/52, 90 and 4000 can load a boot image from a TFTP server.
This works only for images that load to internal RAM. 
The images that load to SDRAM cannot be booted this way, but they will
run from a memory card.


In order to boot the netX 51/52 via Ethernet, the following requirements must be met:
- a DHCP/BOOTP server
- a TFTP server
- No boot image must be in the flash.

In this example, we are using TftpD32 from http://tftpd32.jounin.net .
We set up the servers to run on a dedicated ethernet interface to which the netX 51/52 is connected.

Configuration of the Ethernet interface:
Assign a fixed IP V4 address, e.g. 192.168.210.200, subnet mask 255.255.255.0

Configuration of the DHCP/BOOTP service:
- The IP address/netmask of the ethernet interface
- A pool of IP addresses to distribute via DHCP, e.g. 10 addressses starting from 192.168.210.210.
- The name of the boot image that the netx shall load.

Configuration of the TFTP service:
- The directory containing the file to be booted by the netX.
