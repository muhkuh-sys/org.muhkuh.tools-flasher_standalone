This is the standalone flasher, a version of the flasher that can be started 
by the netx as a boot image and contains the data to be flashed.

The standalone flasher is just the bare flasher program. In order to use it,
you attach the data to be flashed at the end and adjust the boot header.

How to build
------------

0) Install python 2.7

1) Build the flasher including the library version

  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/muhkuh-sys/org.muhkuh.tools-flasher.git
  cd org.muhkuh.tools-flasher
  python mbs/mbs
  
  This creates the directory 'targets/flasher_lib' containing library versions 
  of the flasher and some includes.

2) Build the standalone flasher 
  
  git clone --recurse-submodules  https://github.com/muhkuh-sys/org.muhkuh.tools-flasher_standalone.git
  
  copy the directory 
  'org.muhkuh.tools-flasher/targets/flasher_lib' to 
  'org.muhkuh.tools-flasher_standalone/flasher_lib'
  
  cd org.muhkuh.tools-flasher_standalone
  python mbs/mbs

3) Build a boot image with data to flashed
  This is done using the python script 'append.py' in the bootimage directory.
  The bootimage directory contains an example that flashes a blinki program.
  
  cd bootimage
  build_bootimages.bat
